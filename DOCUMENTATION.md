FAST-CLI DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

This document contains the background of FAST-CLI and why we decided to create with the current workflow.

#### Context

In order to enable software engineers/developers to easily use FAST platform, creating a command-line tool would be very helpful.

#### Goals

The command-line tool should have following features:

- Create a default template to develop a FAST module
- Build the module to be a release module as a .so file
- Support release versioning, hence it can be rollback anytime to previous version
- Upload and apply the released module into FAST platform 

#### Non-Goals

None.
